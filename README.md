# EgammaTnP-coffea
Egamma HLT efficiency from NanoAOD using Tag and Probe in the [coffea](https://github.com/CoffeaTeam/coffea) framework.

This is currently a very early draft version written in a Jupyter notebook.
Once the core functionality is well established and tested, it will be transformed to a full package to perform Tag and Probe over whole datasets on the LPC cluster.
